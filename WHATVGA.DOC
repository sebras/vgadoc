Command line switches:

  whatvga [+acumos] [-ncr] [=1024]

  where +chipset  forces WHATVGA to proceed as if this chipset was found.
                  The test for this chip set will be executed in order
                  to check for memory and revision.
                  No other chipsets will be tested.

        -chipset  ensures that the tests for this chipset will NOT be
                  executed. Useful if a chipset is misidentified
                  or some earlier test gives problems.

        =kbytes   Forces the number of Kbytes of video RAM on the
                  adapter to the specified value.



Whatvga has 6 options in the main menu:

  1 Test standard VGA

    Allows you to test the standard VGA video modes.
    Draws a test pattern, including a color palette
    and writes basic information as text on the display.

  2 Test extended modes

    Allows you to test the extended video modes of the adapter.
    Draws a test pattern, including a color palette
    and writes basic information as text on the display.
    On the upper and left edge every hundred pixels is marked.

  3 Scroll test

    Allows you to test the scroll function of the adapter.
    Draws a test pattern, including a color palette
    and writes basic information as text on the display.
    The test pattern is drawn in the largest resolution there
    is video memory for.
    With the arrow keys you can move around in the pattern.

  4 Search for video modes

    Steps through the video modes 14h to 7Fh to see which ones
    are implemented by this adapter.
    When a video mode is found the rutine attemps to analyse
    the mode and then draws a test pattern to check the analysis.
    When the test pattern is displayed you can view the register
    values by pressing the "d" key, or save them to a file named
    REGISTER.VGA by pressing the "f" key.

  5 Test VESA modes

    This item is only shown if a VESA driver is found.
    Draws a test pattern, including a color palette
    and writes basic information as text on the display.

Acumos AVGA2:

  Scroll doesn't work.


Avance Logic:

  Scroll has problems.
  Search for modes has problems with the width of scanlines
  and determining 256 or 64K colors.


Cirrus 5422:

  Search for Mode has problems determing the number of bytes in a scanline.


NCR:

  Search for modes has problems determining the number of bytes in a scanline
  in all 256 color modes.

Oak:
  The 4 color modes (55h and 57h for the 067) currently doesn't work.

Realtek:

  Mode 23h (1024x768 4color) does not work.
  Scroll has problems with crossing the 512K mark.
  Search for Mode has problems determing the number of bytes in a scanline
  VESA modes doesn't work.


S3:

  The 86c924 is IDed as an 86c911A.
  I hear a rumor that they are actually the same ??


Tseng 3000:

  The Tseng 3000 seems to enable different amounts of memory for
  different modes, thus using "larger than physical" displays
  is rather problematical.


Generel Problems:

I can't tell the difference between the Sierra "Mark2" SC11482/3/4
(15 bits) and the "Mark3" SC11485/7/9 (15/16 bits) RAMDACs.

The Acumos ADAC1 seems to be misidentified as an ATT20c491/2.

With the SS24 DAC I can't tell if we are in an 256, 32768 or 16M color
mode (Search for modes).

On many cards interlaced modes are identified as app. half their
actual height by the Search for modes rutine.

Search for modes doesn't understand 2 and 4 color modes.

Some of the extended modes may only be implemented on
some otherwise similar boards, depending on make and BIOS rev.
